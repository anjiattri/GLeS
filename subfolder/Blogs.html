            <p>Every coin has two sides so does the Patience.See we tend to hear a lot about patience since childhood ironically we do not know the actual meaning of patience, it is the ability to endure something negative that found its way into our world ,without letting it to control our behaviour.Indeed patience is the key to success but how ? Ever questioned ? Having patience means that you can remain calm, even when have been waiting forever or dealing with something painstakingly slow or trying to teach somenone how to do something and they just do not get it . It involves acceptance and tolerance. </p>
            <p>To be patient it takes a lot of courage to stay dedicated and determined. To judge someone who he/she truly is , we see someone common traits like (A)Knowledge (B)Respectful (C) Patient (D) His Believes ,Patience collectively holds all other traits of a person.The world is fast, we should keep our pace else we lose, here where the patience plays a vital role in deciding ,taking adequate measure for the graowth and keeping the feeling that we could achieve our goal. </p>
            <p>We know that Time never held with someone, some may think being patient would make them slow and they can not match up with Time, but here is the thing if you really need to achieve something you must give Time. The Time and Patience are the two legs of the ladder with right amount of work you can step up and the knowledge you gain which helps you to stay still.Good things take time ,the one who understands this and accepts this must have some dose of patience in him/her.</p>
            <p>Change is the only subtle constant, CHANGE is often hard in beginning, messy in the middle and gorgeous in the END. To keep up with the change one is likely expected to be patient and tolerant to idolize the change. </p>
            <p> The beautiful thing about patience is, it is the perfect pivot between Hope and Acceptance.</p>
